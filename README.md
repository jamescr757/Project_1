# The Movie Source

### Overview 

This application is a one-stop shop for movie watchers. Users can watch trailers and look at movie details like the rating, plot, runtime, etc. for any movie. The app is connected to a movie database API, so the Upcoming movies stay up-to-date. The movie trailers are delivered through YouTube's API.

### User Experience 

The home page is essentially a cover page. The carousel rotates movie posters from the Upcoming category. The posters flanking the carousel are randomly pulled from the Top Rated and Popular categories. Therefore, the home page should always look different giving it a fresh look. 

Each category page is laid out the same way with a grid of 10 movies. A user can click on a movie poster to view more information about that movie. The pop-up modal also has a tab to view trailers for that movie. 

If the user wants to search for the movie, the search results will be displayed like a category page. Similarly, the user can click on a search result to view more information or watch a trailer.

### File System 

The file system is straightforward. This is a strictly front-end application.
